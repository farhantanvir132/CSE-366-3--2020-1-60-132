# Assignment 1: Enhanced Dynamic Robot Movement System
This folder contains all the deliverables for the "Enhanced Dynamic Robot Movement System" project.
## Files
- `CSE366_Assignment_1_(3)_2020-1-60-132.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook with the simulation implementation.
- `CSE 366 Assignment-1.pdf`: A detailed report of the project.

## Running the Simulation
To run the simulation, ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed and open
`CSE366_Assignment_1_(3)_2020-1-60-132.ipynb`.

## Brief Description
The goal of this work is to describe the development and implementation of an advanced simulation environment for a robot exploring a dynamically generated grid. There are mainly two classes, environment class and agent class. Where environment class mainly representing the grid layout, possible actions and results. Grid layout consist of value 0 and 1, where 1 represents an obstacle and 0 is free space for robot to move.......(View CSE 366 Assignment-1.pdf for details).
