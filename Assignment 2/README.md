## Brief Description
The Robot Task Optimization Problem involves allocating tasks to robots in a way that minimizes the total production time while balancing the workload across all robots. The optimization process is conducted using a Genetic Algorithm, which iteratively evolves a population of candidate solutions to find the best assignment of tasks to robots. In this report, we present a detailed analysis of how Genetic Algorithm optimization was employed to address the task assignment problem. The study explores .......(View CSE 366 Assignment-2.pdf for details).
